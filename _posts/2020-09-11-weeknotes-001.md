## Weeknotes #001

What I did on the 2nd week of September 2020.

### Work

Came back after a weeks leave, spent some time catching up. Really enjoyed reviewing user research, every time I see these I'm reminded how useful it is, how much it reveals and informs our conversations. Also how much talent and skill is required to get the best out of these interviews, more on how to do that well [here][service-manual-user-research]. I worry stuff like this makes a User Centered Design (UCD) approach seem like common sense when you've got these resources before you, but I'm not sure I could have articulated that I was missing this from my working life before I saw it!

A lot of preparitory work as we draw together our cards and tickets, building consensus before we ship a prototype into live user testing. This will be a great opportunity to learn more about our service, if it does what we expect and what we'll need to improve on.
