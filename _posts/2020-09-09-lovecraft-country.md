I heard about lovecraft country on the [Imagined Worlds podcast][imagined-worlds], [Epsidoe 148: Inverting lovecraft][e148-inverting-lovecraft]. They discussed the relationship is between Lovecraft's captivating stories, and his viciously racist views. Saying you can separate the work from the author, or explaining it away as a work of it's time seems suspect to me. Instead the podcast puts forward the idea that the two are intimately linked. You can believe in heiarchy and place yourself on top, but there's always the fear that "the order" could be inverted. The fear that something even higher up than you could emerge out of places unknown. What a terror it would be if "we" could be swept away, or enslaved by monsters.

There are options other than disgrding it though. The podcast speaks to authors that want to use his language of terror, madness and fear to tell new stories whilst challenging who we should fear for, and that's what Matt Ruff does here.

The book provides different outings into the cosmic unknown, structured around a couple of families.

I was suprised by the books structure at first, the long opening chapter left me thinking we'd get a single continious story. Instead we get different outings into the cosmic unknown, structured around a single family. There's a looming story arc that connects these and provides a sense of progress, but some of my favourite moments
