I've really struggled to find horror writing that I really enjoy. I get a real thrill out of the new film wave of "elevated horror" (translation, it's horror but also a well made film with something interesting to say).

I think it's fair to say I didn't find Ari Aster in this book, but I'm not sure that's what it set out to be.

The setting brought me a world I've not really come across before, which I enjoyed. The structure left me reeling a bit as we jump between time and protagonists. I wasn't sure when it wanted me to be confused and realise something slowly, or when I'd just missed a beat. Also a surprisingly amount of time given to basketball.

An interesting read but I'm still looking for a written horror I can rave about.
