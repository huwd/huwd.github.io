Carried straight on from middle one to this. There feels like a gap between the first and second in the series, but these two fit closely. It continues to flesh out the world and fill gaps with our beloved cast. The problems I had with some things fitting neatly continue here, and are worse. Some of the links between character's pasts and presents are a little too neat for me.

The set pieces are great though and it makes for a fitting climax to the series.

Pigoons. I feel very differently about them now.

I'd recommend the entire series.
