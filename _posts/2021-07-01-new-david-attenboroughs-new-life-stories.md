More of the same from [Quest under capricorn][1], and that is no bad thing.

Instead of focusing on a single period or trip, we now graze broadly from across the natural world and and through his extraordinary career.

The renown for Attenborough's voice and cadence can often hide the skill with which he uses it. I have heard many slip into Attenboroughish tones to narrate the world around them for comic effect. Whilst some impressions cut close, none mange the way he wields a range of voice to draw you through a story. Sarcasm, enthusiasm, reproach, joy and sadness are all lightly suggest in his tones.

His skill is making scientific communication entertaining for long enough to be enlightening.
I'd happily listen to hours more.
