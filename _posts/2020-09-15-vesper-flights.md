I enjoyed [H is for Hawk][h-is-for-hawk], and I'm a sucker for history of science and natural history. So Vesper Flights seemed natural to pick up, I'm so glad I did.

A collection of essays, the format works well for this kind of book. I'd like to find more of the type. Her biography and elegant writing style weave continuity between chapters on a range of subjects. Since finishing the book I've been annoying those around me with ideas that resurface from the book as we walk around.

A clear blue day? The sky is a primary habitat, with it's own pelegic wildlife.
Nesting birds? The class system dictates who and how nature can be enjoyed.
Dead animal? We're sentimental to, longing for, outraged by animals. It says more about us than them.

Natural history gave me an interest and curiosity for far flung places. Some of the essays follow that tradition here. Many, however, are closer to home. During a pandemic when my access to the world has shrunk, I'm finding the natural history of home more gripping. It feels like a gift to have reasons to look out my own window, or over nearby fields and find fascination.
