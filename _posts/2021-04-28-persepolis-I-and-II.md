> "Images are a way of writing. When you have the talent to be able to write and to draw, it seems a shame to choose only one. I think it's better to do both".

I read a bit about the comic after finishing it.

Both the book itself and interviews make the case for comics as a way to bridge a gap in understanding. Take dramatic events from modern Iranian history and make them legible to the world.

If that is what she set out to achieve, then the author has done a great job.

A human and complex portrayal of a character, grappling with world events of world history that I should really have known more about by now.

Comics can do a lot more than I thought, I should take them more seriously as literature.
