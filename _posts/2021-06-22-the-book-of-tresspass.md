I kept seeing landscapes out of windows. I picked this book up when looking for some thoughts about how they came to be. How they worked.

I found much more, and was pleasantly surprised. A history of land, ownership and popular history of those who lived outside the manor hall. It quickly reminded me of the blog ["Who owns england"][1], and the author makes an appearance at one or two points.

I am still not sure who this book is for. At times it seemed like it might be a reach out beyond the left to take a more common love of the natural world as a base to query the access to it. At other times it picks the confident utopian speech that the left uses when talking to itself.

Missing the wood for the trees, it is easy to see nature as outside of politics or history.
This book does a good job of reuniting the two. In the links it makes we can see a through line from injustices of old to political conversations that remain alive today.
