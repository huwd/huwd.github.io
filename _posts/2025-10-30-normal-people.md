I saw the TV show first, then fled to the book to hold on to a scrap of those feelings.
It left me confused.
There isn’t much in these stories I recognise from my own life at this age.
Yet the story leaves me with a strong sense of nostalgia.

Late in the book, a character says:
> “It’s funny the decisions you make because you like someone, he says, and then your whole life is different. **I think we’re at that weird age where life can change a lot from small decisions.**”

I have been at an age when my life changed a lot from small decisions.
The life I live now is the product of choices that seemed both enormous and inconsequential at the time.
The most lasting are tied to the people I shared that time with.
They feel as much like impressions we left on each other as choices I made myself.

It's a set in a period where I also came of age, but the familiarity goes beyond that time.
I'm left with a strong, homely, troubling nostalgia I find stuck with since finishing it.
And a hunger to peek back into their lives, in hopes I can recall more of my own.

That aside, it’s one of the best things I’ve read this year.
