I think I accidentally bought this book, but it turned out well.

I can imagine what the blurb might have been, and I can imagine putting it back on the shelf after reading it.

But, by the time I realised this book was an unusual choice, I was interested to see where it was going.
The central character's live was unfolding in interesting ways, and I was also entranced by it's descriptions of the natural world that surrounds her.

I spent a lot of time zooming around on google earth looking at the Great Dismal Swamp whilst listening to this.

A world away, it took me briefly and enjoyably out of an early Covid lockdown.
