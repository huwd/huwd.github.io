Herzog's last book really stuck with me.
Its biography and musings were wide-ranging.
I was caught in the stream of his thoughts, bobbing through vivid scenes of a Bavarian childhood, violent natural wonders, and encounters with human extremes.

This book feels like a coda or afterthought.
Like leaving the party he turned to add "just one more thing" before launching into a monograph on truth.

But it's a provoking one.
I used to idolise Cinéma vérité and documentary filmmakers who sought to get to the truth of things.
I find myself less confident in that project now.
When a humble nature documentary is composed of images shot across years, sometimes even continents and different animals, yet strung seamlessly into a sequence of seconds, it's easy to become disillusioned about truth.
This line of thought never led anywhere productive, though.
Just to a kind of grumpy sniff at those who reach for the real.

Herzog returns to tell us that in an age of ever-easier fabrication, a reach back to Vérité brings no truth.
Only 'accountants' truth'; he seeks an 'ecstatic truth'.
In his 1999 manifesto, he described this as:
> “There are deeper strata of truth in cinema, and there is such a thing as poetic, ecstatic truth. It is mysterious and elusive, and can be reached only through fabrication and imagination and stylization.”

He wants something that goes beyond a mere retelling of events into something that resonates more deeply.
Something almost dreamlike but which holds great meaning.

It feels timely.
In a world where trusted ground is eroding in a sea of slop, truth feels difficult to come by.
I think he's right that a mere description of the facts is likely insufficient in response to that tide.
Something deeper, more resonant feels like the order of the day.
There's something empowering in that, a feeling of agency in a world that seems designed to make you question if anything solid can be held on to.

But I'm left with a fear, too.
Ecstatic truth might burn bright, care less about the nitpicking details in favour of the resonant whole. It may have a shattering force of emotion that bridges voids to touch an audience, but do those virtues mean it's less susceptible to deceit?

Aren't we talking about a tool demagogues the world over have employed with the shattering force of their rhetoric?
Is the ecstasy the important bit, and the truth or lie of it a secondary concern?
