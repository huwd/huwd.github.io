> “…I also believe that white people who recognise racism have an incredibly important part to play. That part can’t be played while wallowing in guilt. White support looks like financial or administrative assistance to the groups doing vital work. Or intervening when you are needed in bystander situations. Support looks like white advocacy for anti-racist causes in all-white spaces. White people, you need to talk to other white people about race. Yes, you may be written off as a radical, but you have much less to lose.”

A clear, compelling and comprehensive summary of our complacency.
With a reasonable ask that we face history, the inequality of the present and understand the structural racism that renews it daily.
A measured fury in calling to action that white people to take their share of the burden in undoing what they built.
