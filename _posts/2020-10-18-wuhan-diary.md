The value of Chinese voices grows with each [connection we][wexin-ban] [sever][sinica-the-american-journalists-still-in-china] between our countries.

By late August the first wave of UK coronavirus was waning but none of us knew (or yet know) where this goes. I'd hoped to get a lot of things from this book: a better account of the early days of the virus, clarity on the chinese policy response, perhaps a view into our future. Mostly I didn't find out too much new, many of her points had been well summarised in the better news coverage of the summer.

Instead I found far more that was familiar than new. I found my fears, my hunger for information, my burning impatience with authorities, all reflected back from a world away. It would be crass to take this as a simple sign of human unity in the face of the virus. I believe the virus has revealed more entrenched division, than it has brought us together.

In short I enjoyed hearing directly from someone in the midst of world events, especially as my chances to hear Chinese voices seems to be shrinking. Sincia did great coverage in conversation with [Micheal Berry][sincia-micheal-berry-interviewed], at this point there may be as much to be learned from those interviews as the book itself (it was a series of in-situ blog posts after all!).

I shall have to learn to read more Chinese blogs, then perhaps I can be more proactive about hearing the voices I'm missing these days.
