A really neat concept that I won't spoil here.

The core concept grows neatly from a plot device that surrounds our characters into a new universe.
And what a universe it is.

Heros and villains end up being more players in an ecosystem. All players have motivations, and a moral high ground can be difficult to find.

The book lays a solid ground of universe, and uses that to take us on an adventure through new york with an ensemble cast.

I really enjoyed it - and apparently it will be the first in a series.
