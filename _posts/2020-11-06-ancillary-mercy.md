A satisfying end to an enjoyable trilogy.
It pays off the long running themes and sees loose threads well tied before we go.

Many of the themes of interest have been preserved, expanded and now seem richer three books in.
It's a universe I'll miss.

I heard all as audio books, where Adjoa Andoh does all the heavy lifting with impenetrable names.
Her chameleon vocal skills bring an impressive range of these characters to life.
A fantastic performance when i think of these characters it's her voice in who speaks for them.

All three make for a fun, thought provoking read.
