I love short-story collections, but I always find them somewhat uncomfortable.

The rapid tour through ideas and scenes often packs so much into such a short space of time. Yet a good chunk of that time I find myself at sea. Where are we now? Who are these people? Why do I care?

With a novel, you get these things out of the way in the first handful of pages, then enjoy the rest from that secure blanket. With short stories, by the time you know where you are, they’re done.

Here the situation was compounded by reading stories from someone I know as a “renowned author”. Expectations are high, and the first signs of scrabbling to locate the narrative make me think it’s all a sham and that I should go and try something else.

But finishing this collection reminded me how much there is to be found in persisting.

The book includes A Small Incident, My Old Home, Kong Yiji, Regret for the Past, The Misanthrope, Village Opera, and After Death.

Long after I’ve forgotten the specifics, I suspect I’ll hold on to some of the vivid portraits it gives of its characters: deeply humane figures pursuing ordinary lives while skirting the edge of destitution. The collection makes you feel like a ghost moving from room to room across a country, catching these moments of life as you pass.

The awkwardness between master and servant who once played together as children. A destitute scholar whose visits to an inn trace a life in decline. Two lovers who believe they can forge their own path, then nurture regret over how it fell apart. A mourned grandmother and an emptied life. A childhood night at the opera. A death.

One hundred years later, and translated across the world, the stories still land with wonderful images unlike most of what I’ve read in the past few years.
