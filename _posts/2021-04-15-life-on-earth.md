In the documentary Cosmos, Carl Sagan talks through the major
groups of life that exists on earth.

At one point he shows a diagram showing one how one branch
tumbled through evolution and resulting in Humans.

If you like the idea of that diagram, but as a book, read by
David Attenborough, and with a more about other parts of the
tree of life... then this is the book for you!
