There's a tonal shift here, that I struggled with at times.
Like taking the swashbuckling adventures of the initial book and then tracking them into more of a desk job in the second.

Our character's personalities seemed adrift from how I'd understood them before. But perhaps that's the point, I now look back and question what is real and what was a mask on a path to sentience.

However it broadened the universe, raised the stakes and drew me along.

An enjoyable read.
