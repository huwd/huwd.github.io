Similar to the first, I started a bit lot, but now we move around times and between protagonists too.

It delivers on content, I was hungry to know more about this world and the characters, and it's new cast was compelling. However the format is disappointing compared to it's predecessor. It might have been gaudy to try and re-use flipping from past to future again. The first book used it to such great effect that this seems plainer by comparison.

I also feel it cedes a bit of the contingency of the first book. There was nothing special about snowman. He was just there. But now we find other protagonists, and they all happen to have crossed paths too. Good for drama, but stretches my disbelief.

Pigoons creep me out.

Still a great read. Will read the third one too.
