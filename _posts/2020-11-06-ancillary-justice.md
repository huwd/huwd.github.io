I enjoy seeing well trod topics done well in Sci Fi, but there is a special joy in finding something new.

Here there are both. Machine's escaping their use as tools into something more disobediently alive. Done well.

But this story is really about multitudes in a way I'd never considered. What does distributed intelligence mean? How does it parts interact? Is it immortal? How does it feel when cut off from it's conscious self?

These are new ideas to me, well explored here.
