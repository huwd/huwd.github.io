An entire society forgets that a month happened, and no-one is really sure why.
Those that recall something more, or even recall the loss, are torn socially adrift.

I have wanted to read more Chinese science fiction since reading Cixin Liu's "Three body problem" trilogy a few years back.

I did not enjoy the book as much as Cixin Liu's work, but has an intriguing core mystery that propelled me through it in short order.

Strangely the audiobook I listened to also comes bundled with a load of literary criticism on the book. The last hour or two of listening are a critics take, especially on some of the climatic chapters.

I found these interesting, but somewhat like an episode of the [Sinica podcast][1] had escaped my feeds and snuck into audible.

An odd but interesting and enjoyable read.
