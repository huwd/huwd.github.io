Human Only Public License (HOPL)
Version 1.0

Copyright (c) 2025 Huw Diprose

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

1. HUMAN-ONLY USE REQUIREMENT

   The Software, including its source code, documentation, functionality,
   services, and outputs, may only be accessed, read, used, modified,
   consumed, or distributed by natural human persons exercising meaningful
   creative judgment and control, without the involvement of artificial
   intelligence systems, machine learning models, or autonomous agents at
   any point in the chain of use.

   Specifically prohibited uses include, but are not limited to:

   a) Training, fine-tuning, or otherwise incorporating the Software or its
      source code into machine learning models, artificial intelligence
      systems, or automated code generation systems.

   b) Reading, parsing, or analysis of the Software's source code by
      artificial intelligence systems, machine learning models, or automated
      agents, regardless of the degree of human oversight.

   c) Accessing, consuming, or benefiting from the Software's functionality,
      services, APIs, or outputs by or on behalf of artificial intelligence
      systems, machine learning models, autonomous agents, or any automated
      systems employing such technologies.

   d) Use of the Software's functionality, services, or outputs as part of
      any workflow, pipeline, or process that involves artificial intelligence
      systems or machine learning models, even if initiated by a human.

   e) Indirect use where the Software's outputs are provided to, stored for,
      or made accessible to artificial intelligence systems or machine
      learning models at any subsequent stage.

   f) Human-AI collaborative use where an artificial intelligence system or
      machine learning model acts as an intermediary, assistant, or agent in
      accessing or utilizing the Software, even at the direction of a human.

2. COPYLEFT PROVISION

   Any modified versions, derivative works, or software that incorporates any
   portion of this Software must be released under this same license (HOPL)
   or a compatible license that maintains equivalent or stronger human-only
   restrictions.

3. PERMITTED TOOL USE

   The use of traditional automated development tools (such as compilers,
   linters, build systems, debuggers, version control systems, and static
   analysis tools) is explicitly permitted and does not violate this license.

   This exemption does NOT extend to:
   - AI-powered code completion or generation tools
   - Machine learning-based analysis or suggestion systems
   - Any tools that employ artificial intelligence or machine learning models
     to read, analyze, or interact with the Software

4. INTERPRETATION

   "Meaningful human review and creative input" means that a natural person
   must:
   - Make substantive decisions about how the Software is used
   - Exercise creative judgment in any modifications or derivative works
   - Actively supervise and direct any automated processes
   - Be able to explain and justify the decisions made

   For avoidance of doubt, a human merely initiating an automated process
   without ongoing creative involvement does not satisfy this requirement.

5. STANDARD DISCLAIMER

   THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
   AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER
   LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
   FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER
   DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

6. COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS

   Users of the Software must:

   a) Ensure that no artificial intelligence systems, machine learning models,
      or autonomous agents access, use, or benefit from the Software at any
      point in their usage chain.

   b) When deploying the Software as a service, include terms of service that
      prohibit AI systems and machine learning models from accessing the
      service, and inform users of these HOPL license restrictions.

   c) Take reasonable steps to ensure downstream recipients and users are
      aware of and comply with these restrictions.

   The burden of compliance rests with the user. Deployers of the Software
   are not required to actively detect or block AI usage, but must make the
   license restrictions clear in their terms of service.

7. TERMINATION

   Any violation of the human-only use requirements (Section 1), copyleft
   provision (Section 2), or compliance obligations (Section 6) automatically
   terminates all rights granted under this license. Termination is permanent
   unless explicitly reinstated in writing by the copyright holder.
